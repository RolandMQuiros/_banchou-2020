# Cosmology
Some SMT shit. Human behavior cause changes in a metaverse and vice versa, but the former is far stronger, cumulatively, than any reigning power would be willing to admit.

## The Great Alignment
At the start of the story, capitalism has created such global stratification that the experiences of the entire proletariat have begun to converge. Capital's failure to check their own growth has allowed the internet to act as a global unifying force, creating greater empathy across borders than ever before (or is it a side-effect of the alignment?).

Forced into a corner, billions have been forced to organize and fight. Del Abismo is just the latest to tap into this energy. When the entire city is united in this fight, uhhh people can henshin.
